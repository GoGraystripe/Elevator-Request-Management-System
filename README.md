Simulated a multi-elevator scheduling system with state-based control logic and directional request grouping. Designed custom request assignment, pickup batching, and wait-time tracking to minimize average latency under load. Implemented real-time state transitions, queue-based dispatching, and edge-case debugging to improve performance by \textasciitilde45\% over baseline simulation.
